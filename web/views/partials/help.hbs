		<p>Short volume is the number of shares that have been borrowed to open short positions
			(when you sell one or more shares of a stock that you donâ€™t own).</p>
		<p>TightShorts.ru aggregates data from FINRA and presents it in an easy-to-use way.</p>
		<h4>Terminology</h4>
		<ol>
			<li> <strong>Volume, Total Volume (Vol or TV)</strong> - number of shares of all
				executed trades during regular trading hours</li>
			<li> <strong>Short Volume (SV)</strong> - number of shares that have been borrowed to
				open
				short positions</li>
			<li> <strong>Short Exempt Volume (SEV)</strong> - number of shares of all executed
				short sale exempt trades during regular
				trading hours</li>
			<li> <strong>Short Volume Ratio (SV,%)</strong> - percentage of short positions from the
				total
				volume. <em>Formula: SV / Vol * 100</em></li>
			<li> <strong>Short Exempt Volume Ratio (SEV,%)</strong> - percentage of short short sale
				exempt
				trades from the total volume. <em>Formula: SEV / Vol * 100</em></li>
			<li><strong>TV5, SV5,%, SEV5,%</strong> - average Total Volume (TV) / Short Volume (SV) / Short Exempt
				Volume (SEV) for the last <strong>5 trading days</strong> </li>
			<li><strong>TV20, SV20,%, SEV20,%</strong> - average Total Volume (TV) / Short Volume (SV) / Short Exempt
				Volume (SEV) for the last <strong>20 trading days</strong> </li>
		</ol>
		<h4>Filters</h4>
		<ol>
			<li>
				<strong>Available on Tinkoff broker</strong> - show only stocks available on <a
					href="https://www.tinkoff.ru/sl/2B3oswsCDnJ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º Tinkoff
					broker</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Is not complete garbage</strong> - show only stocks that meet the condition: there is trading
				data for at least 5 last trading days, there should be no gaps in volume (zero values) for the last 5
				days, the average volume for 5 days is not less than 5000.
				This filter can remove, among other things, very expensive securities, for example, <a href="/quote/BRK.A"
					target="_blank">BRK.A</a>. Since the sale of even one share in it is a huge
				event.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>In-line sequence of 3 days</strong> - the filter value rose or fell continuously for <strong>3
					days</strong>. That
				is, the value of each day was greater or less than the previous one.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>In-line sequence of 5 days</strong> - the filter value rose or fell continuously for <strong>5
					days</strong>. That
				is, the value of each day was greater or less than the previous one.
			</li>
			<li>
				<strong>Abnormal volume (from 20avg)</strong> - the filter value (short volume, total volume or SEV) on the last
				trading day
				was 3 times more or less than the average volume for 20 trading days (20avg).
